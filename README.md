The hall effect sensor (Hall Effect sensor) will be able to detect the magnetic field in its vicinity thanks to the aforementioned physical law. A magnetic field that can be created by a magnet, a current flowing through a conductor or some third source, the Hall effect sensor will recognize each. The stronger the magnetic field, the higher the voltage will be at the output of this sensor, so it is a sensor with analog output.

Originally designed as a replacement for a failed fanatec CSL pedals sensor that I couldn't find a spare for, now used in my own projects.

# Support the team
We :heart: doing research. New hardware (e.g. oscilloscopes, logic analysers, servos, PCBs) is costly. Feel free to support us and thus accelerate our research activity.
